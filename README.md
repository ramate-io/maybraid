Maybraid is an exploration and combat game with an arbitrarily-large, procedurally-generated world. The game is in early development. It is currently free to play and source available but not intended for redistribution or unapproved modification. See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md) for more details.

> [!WARNING]
> We intend to monetize the game. Hence we are not committed to keeping every part of the source code available.
>
> That being said--if we can find a model that allows us to continue to develop as a source-available or even open-source project--we would love to do so!

You can build the current binary and play directly from this repository:

```shell
nix develop
cargo build -p maybraid --release
./target/release/maybraid
```

> [!NOTE]
> The long term technical fantasia for Maybraid is to integrate it into a decentralized state machine atop the Parabyzantine protocol stack led by the [`gwrdfa` API](https://github.com/ramate-io/gwrdfa). In fact, the initial impetus for this game was to partially to prove the [`gwrdfa` API](https://github.com/ramate-io/gwrdfa) concept.
