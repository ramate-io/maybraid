//! A common constraint representation for building generation.
//!
//! Often, for complicated patterns, authors will use a combination of
//! this representation and direct access to parent types to build
//! the authored type.
//!
//! At the same time, common constructions built only requiring this representation
//! can be reused within authored types.
//!
//! The cells are rectangular prisms, describing authoring bounds.
//! The authored types do not need, however, to author strictly rectangular geometry.
