//! **Strict stalk** segments in the **shared** [`crate::BallStickChain`]: hysteresis that keeps growth collinear (no lateral branch wander) so the trunk reads as a straight run from ground toward the anchor band.

//! Used when [`super::Anchors`] emits the vertical chain of seed nodes along the stalk **radial centroid**; canopy ring seeds on that same axis then branch under the canopy [`crate::Hysteresis`] recipe.
