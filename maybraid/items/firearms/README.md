# Maybraid Firearms

Firearm recipes assembled from [`firearms-components`](../firearms-components/).

A [`FirearmKit`](src/kit.rs) is a required [`BodyMesh`](src/parts.rs) plus optional barrel / trigger-box / grip / stock / sight. Named [`FirearmConcept`](src/concepts.rs) values are presets of that kit. Mix parts with `kit --trigger-box paddle --grip bump-handle --sight holorand`. Scale kit bones with `scale barrel --length 1.5 --thickness 0.8`.

Iron sights keep the current ADS FOV. [`SightMesh::Holorand`](src/parts.rs) rolls 1–3× of that FOV; [`SightMesh::Leskop`](src/parts.rs) rolls 3–5×. Magnification is stored as vertical FOV (`fov' = 2 atan(tan(fov/2) / zoom)`). Sights socket onto `sight_socket` at a rest scale of the 1 m authored cube. First-person focus stays on `sight_camera_socket`.

[`FirearmWeaponsPlugin`](src/projectiles.rs) fires emissive shots from the receiver `barrel` bone. Put a [`Weapon`](src/projectiles.rs) on the [`FirearmRoot`](src/lib.rs). Auto-fire is the default; add [`FireOnTrigger`](src/projectiles.rs) to require [`WeaponTrigger`](src/projectiles.rs) (written per gun by [`firearm-user`](../firearm-user/)):

| Load | Shape | Motion |
|------|--------|--------|
| Bolt | Capsule (length, radius, speed) | No gravity; despawn when path, through-solid, or age is exhausted |
| Bullet | Same capsule | Gravity on; same budgets |
| Laser | Beam along bone +Y | Grows from the muzzle to the first bore hit (or max length). Despawned when the trigger is released. A ray along the bore writes [`Hit`](../../damage/src/lib.rs) about every 0.15 s |

Muzzle is the barrel tail (`bone-local +Y` of rest length 1). Runtime rest (after the armature’s glTF +90° X) has bore along +Z and grip down; [`aim_plus_x`](src/pose.rs) yaws that onto world +X. Bolts and bullets live in [`projectiles`](../../projectiles/); they sweep [`Fixed`](../../lod/avian/src/layers.rs) and charge [`Flight::through`](../../projectiles/src/lib.rs) with optional [`PenetrationCost`](../../projectiles/src/lib.rs). Each distinct collider crossed emits one [`ProjectileContact`](../../projectiles/src/lib.rs), including multiple contacts in one frame; this crate stamps [`HitPayload`](../../damage/src/lib.rs) onto ballistic flights at spawn and spawns a short Hanabi spark + smoke burst. Bolts without a payload deal no damage. Every shot plays [`WEAPON_FIRE`](src/sound.rs) and [`WEAPON_HAMMER`](src/sound.rs) at the muzzle. Bolts and bullets then attach a looping [`WEAPON_FIZZ`](src/sound.rs) child. Each [`ProjectileContact`](../../projectiles/src/lib.rs) plays [`WEAPON_IMPACT`](src/sound.rs) at the hit point. Distance for both is oddio's `radius / max(distance, radius)`. A laser loops fire on the beam and plays hammer once when the beam starts. Each layer has its own volume and oddio radius (the old Bevy scale inverted to meters). Mixing is an [`oddio::SpatialScene`](https://docs.rs/oddio/0.7.4/oddio/struct.SpatialScene.html): interaural time/level, 1/r, Doppler, and speed-of-sound delay. [`spawn_follow_camera`](../../player-camera/src/lib.rs) carries the listener pose; playgrounds that fire without that helper get one on the lone `Camera3d`.
