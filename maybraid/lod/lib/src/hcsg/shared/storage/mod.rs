///
/// Frame and main-thread code must use [`Self::try_entry`], [`Self::try_overlapping`],
/// and [`Self::try_membership_revision`]. They return [`Busy`] while the worker
/// or eviction sweep holds a store lock.
///
/// Blocking reads ([`Self::get`], [`Self::entry`], [`Self::overlapping`],
/// [`Self::membership_revision`], [`Self::contains`]) are for the generation
/// worker (via [`GenerationContext`](super::context::GenerationContext)) and for
/// tests. Outside `lod` they
/// are only available with the `test-support` feature.
