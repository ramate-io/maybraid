# Player

Capsule body, character visual, and **handoff slots** for camera and pose.

The collider size comes from the character recipe's
[`LocomotionCapsule`](../crozon/characters/src/components.rs), not from this
crate. Spawn uses the humanoid default until a visual is attached; attaching a
recipe reapplies that hull (`Collider`, `ShapeCaster`, component). This crate
does not know about firearms or melee. Item-user crates write the
slots; `player-camera` and overlay systems read them. [`Npc`](src/identity.rs)
reuses the capsule, [`PlayerLook`](src/identity.rs), and locomotion clips
without pad input, `CameraFollow`, or `PlayerVisual` (so first-person face hide
stays on the followed body). Insert [`CharacterLocomotion`](src/body.rs) before
[`PlayerPlugin`] to cap the walkable slope (default ~81°; Durham uses ~70°).
Grounded wish follows this frame's walkable contact plane so hillside
heading is along the slope, not world XZ into the mesh. Walk is the same
target-speed motor as the vegetation capsule: 7 m/s along the plane at 40 m/s²
accel (50 m/s² idle brake), with 0.25× air control. Speed is framed in `dt`,
not a per-frame multiply. Idle grounded motion brakes to rest along that
plane so walkable grades do not slide when solver friction is zero.
[`MotorTraction`](src/contact.rs) plus Avian
[`MotorTractionHooks`](src/contact.rs) own that policy: floor materials keep
high grip for props and ragdolls; motor contacts only block penetration.
Apps must register physics through
[`register_motor_traction_physics`](src/contact.rs) before any other Avian
plugin. Last plane is only a
[`Grounded`](src/body.rs) snap when the caster missed. Off the ground, gravity
owns Y (XZ heading only). A jump is takeoff (impulse delayed) → air → land
recovery; only air is XZ-only. Pad [`CharacterIntent`](../controllers/character/src/intent.rs)
and NPC drive both write [`MoveWish`](src/body.rs) / [`JumpWish`](src/body.rs);
Body applies those for every capsule. Overlapping [`Npc`](src/identity.rs)
capsules get a kinematic XZ [`SoftBump`](src/separation.rs) on `MoveWish`
before realization so pack-mates start steering apart before capsule contacts
shove them. Animated movers contact Fixed geometry and each other; restitution
on the capsule stays zero. Pronograde recipes keep that vertical motor
hull and add a query-only horizontal [`HitCapsule`](../crozon/characters/src/components.rs)
child (`Sensor`, Animated layer) so projectiles can hit the body and tail.
Hit radius follows rest-pose shoulder / hip / torso bone scales, not the motor
radius. The child follows visual yaw; `Health` stays on the body.
