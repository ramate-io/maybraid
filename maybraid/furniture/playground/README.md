# Furniture playground

Isolated `/show` catalog for painted furniture assemblies. No world streamer — assembled world stays on `maybraid-world-playground`.

```bash
cargo run -p furniture-playground -- show bed
cargo run -p furniture-playground -- show chair --seed 9
cargo run -p furniture-playground -- show chest
cargo run -p furniture-playground -- show counter
cargo run -p furniture-playground -- show gallery
```

In-game, press `/` for the same clap commands.

`/show gallery` packs a wall-flush common bedroom, a galley kitchen, and living-room seating with the Richmond packers, then adds authored extremes (flat bed, tall chair, long counter, wall vs free, two finish seeds). Slot wireframes stay visible; painted kinds instance the furniture GLBs from `furniture-components`.
