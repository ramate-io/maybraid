//! Richmond developments: place building hosts (floors, shafts, roofs).
//!
//! Analogous to `chico-groves`: a development fits confines and emits flattened
//! hosts. Every kind of development cell is a [`Development`], one module each
//! under [`development`], with the buildings it assembles as its submodules.
//! The other modules here are what any development builds with: pads, ground
//! probes, scatter and connectivity layouts, and finishes.
//!
//! These are the developments as kit assemblies. Planning reads the ground
//! through a [`SiteGround`] probe and returns the [`PadPlan`]s a development
//! stands on; generating them over real terrain is Richmond's concern.
