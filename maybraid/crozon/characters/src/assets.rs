//! Asset references and authored-scale metadata shared by character species.
//!
//! The character concept spec separates two ideas that are easy to conflate:
//! authored asset normalization and character proportion scaling. The types in
//! this module describe the former. Species proportions, presets, and sliders
//! should multiply a normalized baseline rather than reusing these values as
//! body-shape controls.
